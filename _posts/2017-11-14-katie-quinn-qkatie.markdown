## Katie Quinn, QKatie

Katie Quinn knows her food. For over three years, she's been uploading a new video per week showcasing different recipes she's learned -- from her grandmother in smalltown Ohio to her training at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. Ironically, her now successful career in food journalism all started with a bit of chance and what appeared to be bad luck.

_I felt that spark that I hadn't felt in years. Even as I was going along in my career and things were going well and I thought I had everything together, I realized this is what I missed. I missed this kind of raw creativity, which I think all creatives know what I'm talking about, and I felt it again. -- Katie Quinn_
