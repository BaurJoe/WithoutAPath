By the time this publishes, I'll be out somewhere along the Baja Peninsula in the Sea of Cortés with [Un-Cruise Adventures](https://www.un-cruise.com/destinations/mexico-cruises).<!-- more -->

I've never been the cruise type, so much so that I've never actually even been on a cruise. Something about floating small cities seemed unappealing to me. Plus there's always the inevitable news story involving some cruise and the spread of a disease causing widespread diarrhea.

_No gracias_.

But then I came across Un-Cruise Adventures. The "Adventures" intrigued me.

"I like adventures," I thought. "How can a cruise be an adventure?"

Then I read more. They're small ship cruises, meaning I'm on a boat with just about 80-some other people. That seems much more manageable to me and far less terrifying/obnoxious.

We'll also be hiking, kayaking and snorkeling -- all things I'm more than happy to oblige. When we're not doing that, there's always all you can drink booze -- the one staple of traditional cruises I'm happy to embrace.

Last but not least, I've been a bad neighbor...

_I've never been to Mexico_.

To be a travel writer from the United States, it's always struck me as somewhat odd that I've never been to our southerly neighbor whose country and culture have greatly impacted my own for the better. The closest I've ever been was standing at the San Diego - Tijuana border, watching the mammoth-sized Mexican flag waving over the city. But I never did cross.

Finally, I've crossed, and I'll be back next week with all kinds of words, photos, video and a new episode of [Without A Path](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/without-a-path/id1037475413?l=es&mt=2).

###### IN ADDITION

I do some reading before I travel to any destination for the first time, and I'd like to start making a habit of sharing what I'm reading to, mainly, give a proper literary shout out to different authors. Perhaps that good literary karma will get back to me somehow?*

Bruce Berger's _[Almost An Island: Travels In Baja California](http://www.amazon.com/Almost-Island-Travels-Baja-California/dp/0816519021)_

Fernando Jordán's _[El Otro Méxio: Biografía de Baja California](https://books.google.com/books/about/El_otro_M%C3%A9xico.html?id=E8KcU7KdABIC)_

*Pretty sure my expecting good literary karma in return defeats the purpose. So let's say _I don't_ expect it in return...
