### Where Do I Belong: An Indonesia Travel Story, Alex Jordao

Belgian writer Alex Jordao didn't feel like she belonged growing up in Brussels. She had a Portuguese last name and didn't look like the other kids because of her Indonesian father. Finally, an opportunity came to learn more about her [ancestry](https://withoutapath.com/23andme-dna-testing-review/) and meet her long-lost grandmother for the first time when she traveled to Indonesia with her father. Oh, and she had some half-siblings out there, too, that she didn't learn about until just before the trip. Alex shares her Indonesia travel story, meeting her grandmother, her siblings, and finally making sense of where she comes from.

<blockquote>"Sometimes it's a bit hard. I don't know where I belong. It's really hard to answer the question, 'Where are you from?'."</blockquote>
