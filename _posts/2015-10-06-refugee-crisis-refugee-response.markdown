Darren Hamm spent 10 years traveling between Egypt and Asia. Among his list of adventures includes walking with the grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and exploring the history of the infamous Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia. Today, Hamm has settled down in Cleveland and quenches his cultural thirst by working with refugees at [The Refugee Response](http://therefugeeresponse.org/) --Â a non-profit that empowers refugees to become self-sufficient in their new communities. Darren also shares with Joe his insights on the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe.
