[Jens Notroff](https://jensnotroff.com/) is a German archaeologist based in Berlin. His work takes him to corners of the world where tourists don't typically roam. Most recently he returned from working along the Turkish-Syrian border. He's also a traveler and refuses to believe that the "Golden Age of Travel" is behind us. Jens joins Without A Path to share his experiences as an archaeologist, traveler, and sketch artist.
