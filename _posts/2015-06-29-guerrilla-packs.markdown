Backpacks aren't necessarily the most comfortable accessories in the world, but in backpacking they're essential. After all, your change of dry clothes, food, sleeping bag and other potential equipment aren't going to magically appear at your destination.

(Though that's a multi-million dollar invention waiting to happen. Perhaps the folks behind Star Trek's "beam me up" device can get on it.)

<!-- more -->Back to reality, such an invention continues to eludes us. Thus finding the most comfortable backpacking companion is a necessidy. Somehow and someway, Guerilla Backpacks' Admiral 40L Hiking Backpack manages to do the job with a level of comfort I had never previously experienced in a backpack.

Admiral 40L backpack by Guerrilla Packs. The 40L Admiral uses high-end components such as YKK zippers, buckles and combination 300D polyester fabrics. The Admiral has top and bottom loading points which allow for easy main compartment access while hiking or traveling. Great for a short day trip or hike the Admiral 40L pack has two front and two side pockets to carrying snacks, maps, keys or any small personal ideas.

The adjustable hip belt and lumbar support, allow this pack to comfortably fit both men and women. Other features include exit loop for hydration system, reinforced top grip handle, top lid, lateral compression straps, and accessory mounts. This ultra lightweight pack is only 2.65 pounds and is water-resistant.

Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity to cross mountains and rivers while testing this backpack, though this pack is better designed for day trips. But I did my best to simulate such an adventure around Cleveland Metroparks and nearby Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The lumbar support felt great, supplemented by the aforementioned adjustable hip belt to keep the back comfortably on my back and not swinging around like a dislocated limb. The more the pack feels as if it's part of my body, the better in my opinion.

Luckily, at least for the sake of testing the backpack, I got sprinkled with a bit of rain to test the alleged water-resistance. I'm happy to report that the Admiral fared much better than my poorly planned attire. In fact, had I planned properly with a set of dry clothes once the rain stopped, the Admiral would have saved the day.

At least my lunch stayed dry.

The Admiral 40L Hiking Backpack is available online at [guerillapacks.com](http://www.guerrillapacks.com/hiking-travel-backpack-admiral/), where it was recently cut $30 from $99 to $69.
