When most people talk about traveling to [Chile](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/south-america/), they're thinking about the coast or getting straight into the mountains. That's all well and good, but the capital city certainly deserves at least a day out of your trip. Here are 10 photos of Santiago, Chile that will make you rethink the city.

The Palacio de La Moneda, capitol building of Chile. This was where the CIA-supported coup against Salvador Allende's democratically elected government took place on September 11, 1973. Augosto Pinochet took over, becoming one of the most ruthless military dictators in the 20th Century until a grassroots campaign of activists had him ousted in 1990.

A statue of the aforementioned socialist leader. Allende, by most accounts, took his own life in office reportedly using a weapon given to him by Fidel Castro rather than be captured by Pinochet.

Admittedly not my favorite picture, but I loved the gargantuan Chilean flag.

Granted I still have plenty of traveling to do in Latin America, but Santiago de Chile displayed the most attention to deal in its architecture and art than any other city I had seen in the region.

Catedral Metropolitana de Santiago attracts no shortage of worshippers and tourists along the lively Plaza de Armas.
