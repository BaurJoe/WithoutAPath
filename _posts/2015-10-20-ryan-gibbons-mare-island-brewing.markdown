Ryan Gibbons left college and went looking for himself out in Northern California. Eventually he got into the wine business and followed his boss' advice to "chase harvest" in the southern hemisphere once the season wound down in California. For three years Ryan was off chasing harvest, starting off in New Zealand and even making it to France. Ryan chats with Joe about his experiences abroad and how they all tie together to the launch of [Mare Island Brewing Co.](http://www.mareislandbrewingco.com/) in Vallejo, California.
