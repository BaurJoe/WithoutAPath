U.S. Americans are flocking to Cuba, but you still can't go for purely tourist reasons. Laura of [Far Flung Travels](http://farflungtravels.com) shares her experience of spending five days in Cuba, including the conversations she had with people throughout the island. Then, Joe and Laura talk about carbon emissions from travel, namely flying in light of a recent [YES! Magazine](http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/life-after-oil/how-far-can-we-get-without-flying-20160211) and [Grist article](http://grist.org/climate-energy/a-climate-scientist-who-decided-not-to-fly/) from climate scientist Peter Kalmus, who lays out his reasoning for quitting flying. Should we be flying at all? Is the auto industry a bigger culprit? Should my job not exist? Without A Path gets deep!
