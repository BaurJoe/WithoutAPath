245 kilometers? Cobbled climbs? No problem!

For reasons beyond my comprehension, BMC Switzerland graciously selected me to join five other cyclists from across the globe to join their [granfondo experience](https://withoutapath.com/tour-of-flanders-training/), more tortuously known as the [Ronde van Vlaanderen](https://withoutapath.com/tour-of-flanders-cyclo/). Here I document my experience with a bit of Ronde history mixed in for flavor.

Indeed, cycling here does not suck. And someday, I hope to be back on the cobbles of Flanders.
