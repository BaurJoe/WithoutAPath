## Courtney Tenz, Freelance Writer and Translator

Courtney Tenz is a freelance writer and translator based in nearby Cologne, Germany. We met up a few weeks ago in a park outside of the K21 art museum in Düsseldorf and talked about everything from being an American immigrant in Germany to how you can tell an American from a European by the way they dress.

<blockquote>"One of the things I’ve been doing in the last couple of years since people have bene talking about refugees 'invading the country' has been really paying attention to how other people are being treated around me, using my privilege as an English-speaking immigrant to call out the xenophobia and the bad experiences that other people are having."</blockquote>
