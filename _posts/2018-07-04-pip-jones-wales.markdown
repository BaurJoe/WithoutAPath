## Pip Jones, Welsh Travel Writer

Pip Jones has been traveling and writing for the past 10 years in hopes of recreating a Carrie Bradshaw-esque fantasy of sipping wine and tapping away on her laptop. She joins Without A Path in Düsseldorf by way of Wales to talk about Welsh culture, drinking cocktails on a rooftop in Palestine, and how a childhood admiration of Pip Longstocking started it all.

<blockquote>“A big part of travel is speaking to lots of differnet people and lots of different perspectives and not forming ideas and opinions just from what you've read in stories. It's actually going to these places and speaking to the local Palestinians and all the pople that are affected by the situation there and making up your own mind about the situation and what's going on." -- Pip Jones on traveling in Palestine</blockquote>
