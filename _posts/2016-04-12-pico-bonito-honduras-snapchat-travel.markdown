[Honduras](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/international/central-america/honduras/) comes with a travel warning that sounds like the synopsis of a crime film. So naturally I've been intrigued to see if, like my travels to [El Salvador](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/international/central-america/el-salvador/), reality paints a more nuanced picture. With that in mind, I share with Laura my experience traveling to and around Pico Bonito National Park in northern Honduras with [The Lodge at Pico Bonito](http://www.picobonito.com/). Joe and Laura also discuss using [Snapchat](https://withoutapath.com/snapchat-travel/) while traveling.

**Editor's Note:** In the show, Laura and Joe discuss using a third-party to upload photos to Snapchat. Cailin O'Neil of [TravelYourself.ca](http://travelyourself.ca) has since let us know that using said third-party apps can get your account deleted from Snapchat if caught, so proceed (or don't) at your own risk.
