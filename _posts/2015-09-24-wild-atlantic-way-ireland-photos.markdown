I spent the last week traveling around County Donegal in Ireland along the [Wild Atlantic Way](http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home/) -- a 2,500-kilometer scenic road that stretches up to northwestern County Donegal. Locals often refer to the area as "Raw Ireland" and it just so happened to be the topic of my chat with Failte Ireland tour guide Mary Phelan on the latest [Without A Path](https://withoutapath.com/irish-tourism-mary-phelan/).

The thing about Ireland is that anyone with a functioning lens has a pretty damn good chance of coming back with phenomenal photos. In the case of these 18 shots, it's all Ireland and very little of me.<!-- more -->

Looking away from the [Grainán of Aileach](http://www.discoverireland.ie/Arts-Culture-Heritage/grianan-of-aileach/73795), spitting distance from the Derry/Londonderry border of Northern Ireland.

Chef Brian McDermott has earned a name for himself as "The No Salt Chef" after a string of heart attacks forced him to rethink his diet. His cooking calls for allowing the natural salts in food -- such as the saltwater in fish -- to provide your salt intake and allow the flavors of the food to come out rather than hide under a batch of salt.
