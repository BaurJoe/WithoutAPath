## Immigrant and Classical Guitarist, Arturo Castro Nogueras

Arturo Castro Nogueras has been an immigrant for most of his life. Born in [Mexico](https://withoutapath.com/traveling-baja-peninsula-uncruise/), his family moved to [Puerto Rico](https://withoutapath.com/trip-to-puerto-rico-playa-colora/) where he continued his exploration of music and his familial roots in Cuba. As he progressed with classical guitar, he moved to [Düsseldorf, Germany](https://withoutapath.com/travel-guides/germany/) to study in the heart of classical music, blending his favorite influences from Latin America with his new surroundings in Europe.

<blockquote>“I cannot identify 100 percent with Mexico right now or Puerto Rico or Germany even. But that liberates me in a way.”</blockquote>
