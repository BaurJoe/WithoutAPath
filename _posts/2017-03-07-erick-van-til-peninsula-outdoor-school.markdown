[Erick van Til](https://about.me/erick.van.til) is the Director of Program Development at the [Peninsula Outdoor School](http://www.peninsulaos.org/) based in [China](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/international/asia/china/), but it took losing his job in [Canada](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/north-america/canada/) to motivate him to travel throughout Southeast Asia and eventually find his dream job. Erick shares his travel experiences in Southeast Asia and walks listeners through a typical trip with the program.

[Tenerife Sur](https://withoutapath.com/travel-guides/tenerife-sur-spain), the Spanish Canary Island, can be punishingly touristy. That doesn't mean it's impossible to get off the tourist trek. In the latest of our ongoing series of "[Off The Tourist Trek](https://withoutapath.com/travel-guides/)" travel guides, we take a look at the southern end of the island, starting in Los Cristianos and working our way into Teide National Park.

It seems like 2017 is going to fly by with trips planned well through summer. [Berlin](https://withoutapath.com/cycling-the-berlin-wall-trail/), Amsterdam, Antwerp and Ghent to ride the [Ronde van Vlaanderen](https://withoutapath.com/belgium-tour-of-flanders-cycling-sportive/) (or [Tour of Flanders](https://withoutapath.com/cycling-tour-of-flanders-belgium/)), the Black Forest, Munich, Warsaw, Huntsville, Alabama for [TBEX](http://tbexcon.com/2017-north-america/), Palm Springs for another travel conference, and a trip to Luxembourg City for their National Day celebration will take us through June. Have any tips on how to get off the tourist trek in these destinations? Share them and they might be included in future coverage of these destinations at withoutapath.com.
