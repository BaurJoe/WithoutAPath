During a January trip to Austin, Texas, I partook in a brief [kayaking excursion around Lady Bird Lake](https://withoutapath.com/lady-bird-lake/). Like typical travelers bent on capturing every-moment-possible-on-camera, my friends and I posed for a picture, all of us side-by-side in our kayaks.

Because I thrive in making everyday recreational moments seem like some sort of rare feat worth recording in the annals of our time, I hoisted my paddle into the air as if we had just literally conquered Lady Bird Lake. The water was our enemy combatant, and we had throttled it into submission... Or something.

<!-- more -->The result was the photo you see above.

This, it turns out, caught the attention of Google. Yes, THE Google. Or at least some marketing agency working for THE Google. A month or two following our triumphant victory over the tyrannical waters of Lady Bird Lake, I was asked if we would be willing to give THE Google rights to use our picture in an Austin commercial.

"Why the Hell not?" I thought. "It's certainly something I can overstate on a résumé."

And so, as you'll see below, I alongside my brothers and sisters in paddles made our Austin commercial debut.

See it? During the second half of the twelfth second? (Obviously we didn't get an ENTIRE second to ourselves.)

On behalf of the not-even-remotely notable, I'd like to thank the marketing agency who stumbled across our picture for taking the time to send me an email. Make no mistake, America. If I can make a half-second appearance in a regional commercial outside of my home, so can you. Keep the dream alive!

Thank you, Jesus.
