Andy MacGregor, founder of [Travel Massive's Madrid chapter](https://travelmassive.com/chapters/madrid), shares how (and why) he made the move from Scotland to Spain complete with all the current events you didn't know about. He's since gotten his face on Spanish television's Canal Plus as the host of a fishing program. When he's not keeping an eye on his line, he edits [CARPdiem Magazine](http://carpdiem.es/) and even runs a swing dance course.
