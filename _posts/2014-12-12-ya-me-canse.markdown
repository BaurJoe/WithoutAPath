Not exactly a travel story here. Like, at all. But it is perhaps much more worthy of sharing here than any of my previous ramblings.

Last week I had the honor of assisting in the production of a video made at Costa Rica's University For Peace to highlight solidarity with the 43 students who went missing in Mexico. This production was the brainchild of Andrea LÃ³pez-Portillo, who herself is from Mexico. For more on the production and why it was made, head on over to the [UPEACE Human Rights and Cinema Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hrcinema/posts/1516417455308979).

If you are so inclined, feel free to share using some form of the hashtag #YaMeCanse.
