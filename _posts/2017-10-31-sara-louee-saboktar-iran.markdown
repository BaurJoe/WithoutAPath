## Sara Louee, Travel Writer at Saboktar

Iran comes packed with stereotypes in the western world, but Iranian travel blogger Sara Louee says Iranians have their own stereotypes for westerners. After backpacking [Europe](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/international/europe/) herself, Sara has turned her sights toward mending this gap with her own writing, traveling across the Persian nation, and sharing her travels among a collective of Iranian solo female travel writers at Saboktar.

<blockquote>I really want to let the world know about my country, because Iran has so much potential for traveling. -- Sara Louee</blockquote>
