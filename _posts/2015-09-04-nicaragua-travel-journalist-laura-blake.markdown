Travel journalist Laura Watilo Blake of [Far Flung Travels](http://www.farflungtravels.com) talks with Joe about her career behind the camera, living in Peru and how getting slapped in Nicaragua got her published with [Frommer's](http://www.frommers.com/). If you want to ignore my nonsense, skip ahead to Laura around the seven minute mark.
