Recently I had the privilege of working with [Failte Ireland](http://www.failteireland.ie/) and [Tourism Ireland](https://www.tourismireland.com) on checking out [The Wild Atlantic Way](http://www.wildatlanticway.com/), specifically in northwestern County Donegal with a quick stop in County Sligo on the way back to Dublin. I'll mostly let the video speak for itself, but The Wild Atlantic Way is a 2,500-kilometer scenic route from southern County Cork up to County Donegal. The latter is arguably the heart of ancient Irish culture. Many locals often referred to it as "Raw Ireland." Here the street signs read in the Irish language without a hint of English. Though tourism exists, it's largely untapped compared to other corners of the Emerald Isle.<!-- more -->

I also want to quickly thank Sarah E. Cullen, who appears in the band scene. Just as I was leaving the Singing Pub, I quickly introduced myself and gave her my card. Later that night I had a message from her and we quickly chatted music. The song in the video is one of her originals via [Andromeda Artisans](http://www.andromedaartisans.com/) and I'm honored to share her angelic voice with you all.

This trip did include a couple of days in Dublin as well, so keep an eye out for that video. I'll also be doing a little story -- just a tad more in-depth -- on The Wild Atlantic Way elsewhere. As always, you'll be able to find links and all that fun stuff here at withoutapath.com. Meantime, enjoy the video and here's hoping you have your own chance to explore The Wild Atlantic Way or at the very least see Ireland for yourself. It's one of those corners in the globe where anyone, regardless of taste, will fall in love in the most absurdly trite way imaginable.
