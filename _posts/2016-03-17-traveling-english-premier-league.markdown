Traveling for [English football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbiQp5In3TI) is being tapped for its tourism potential. That's why I recently traveled to the United Kingdom with [Visit Britain](https://www.visitbritain.com/us/en/) to attend a Premier League match between top-ranked Leicester City and Newcastle United. Plus, car-free travel around London and Newcastle. Then, [Laura](https://farflungtravels.com/) tells me about how you can travel on a custom budget with [Wherefor](https://www.wherefor.com/). Finally, we turn to some current events around the globe and how they may impact your decision to travel.
