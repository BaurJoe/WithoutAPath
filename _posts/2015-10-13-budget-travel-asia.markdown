People have too much stuff. Why do you need all that stuff? Truth is, you don't. [Charity Yoro](http://www.charityeyoro.com) chats with Joe in San Francisco about her minimalist philosophy for both life and travel. She also shares some of her travels through Southeast Asia, including studying abroad in Thailand and teaching English in South Korea. Then, we hop over to Madagascar and talk about Charity's two-year experience of working in the [Peace Corps](http://www.peacecorps.gov).
