Okayama, Japan. You probably haven't heard of it. In short, it's a less-traveled Japanese prefecture in southern Honshu about four hours by bullet train from [Tokyo](https://withoutapath.com/cycling-in-tokyo/).

Over a couple days of travel, I noticed that it's already perfectly popular with Japanese travelers. But travel there yourself and you'll hardly see a westerner in sight. Yet it has some of the most stunning sights and incredible opportunities to embrace the historic Japanese culture we all have an image of in our mind.

I put this piece together while still traveling in Japan. So rest assured there will be more. Meantime, allow these 17 photos across Okayama to wet your palette for something you might not have been thinking of when dreaming of or actually planning to travel to [Japan](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/asia/).
