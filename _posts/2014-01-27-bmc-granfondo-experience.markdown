_My entry for [BMC's Ride like a Pro contest](http://www.bmctempo.com/gf/taking-on-flanders-joe-b/)._

I find it difficult to go a day without hopping on the saddle. Whether it's cruising 60 miles along Northeast Ohio’s Towpath Trail or catching a spin class to keep in shape during our harsh winters, the bike is home.

Of course my life isn’t just about fitness. Equally important is learning more about my Swiss heritage. And it’s my Swissness that first led me to BMC.

But ultimately the question is why should I be selected. What are my dreams? What do the cobbles of the Ronde van Vlaanderen Cyclo mean to me?

First, of course I’d be great company for the ride! I’m fun. Can’t you tell?

More importantly, my ongoing dream is to constantly find new challenges that I can train myself to overcome. Suffice it to say, I would be honored to take on the cobbles of Flanders’ finest with a BMC jersey on my back.
