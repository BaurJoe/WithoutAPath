Irish tourism has been a juggernaut in the travel industry and remains an international favorite, especially for U.S. Americans looking to discover their family roots. Mary Phelan, an approved Tour Guide with [Failte Ireland](http://www.failteireland.ie/), takes a break from guiding along the [Wild Atlantic Way](http://www.wildatlanticway.com/home/) to chat about how Ireland has been able to go from conflict to a travel must. She also tells Joe a bit about the Wild Atlantic Way, a 2,500-kilometer scenic road that stretches up to northwestern County Donegal -- or as the locals like to call it -- "Raw Ireland."
