[Laura](https://farflungtravels.com)'s fresh off a trip to Vieques, [Puerto Rico](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/international/caribbean/puerto-rico/) and Joe's off to [Honduras](https://withoutapath.com/category/travel/international/central-america/) next week. But first, Laura and Joe look back on the string of [terrorist attacks](https://withoutapath.com/turkey-brussels-terrorist-attacks/) in Brussels, Ankara, Istanbul and Pakistan, and discuss how these tragedies may dissuade people from traveling, but also, how statistics show it's very unlikely you'll be a victim of a terrorist incident. On a happier note, Laura shares thoughts on a recent Cleveland staycation.
