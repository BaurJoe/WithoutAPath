## STORIES ON THE SHOW

[How travel has changed from one generation to the next](http://mashable.com/2016/05/31/travelers-in-2016/#IOgrFlIVzkqg) by Claire Trageser, Mashable

Most millennials — the often maligned group born roughly from 1980 to 2000 — don’t speak five languages, but they have something else in common with Salia: They’re looking for different travel experiences than what their parents did when they were in their twenties.

While they still may visit Europe, many named other destinations as their “if you could go anywhere, where would it be” travel dream. Millennials interviewed for this story said they next wanted to go to countries in South America, Africa and Asia.

Tourism is on an upswing, with hotel and lodging occupancy expected to climb 42 percent from last year.

The bustle kicked off Memorial Day as travel bloggers from all over the world came to Mall of America.

The lakes, the food, the nightlife — writers gathered here to tell the world what so many Minnesotans already know.

[Where was 'The Martian' filmed?](http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2015-10-02/the-martian-comes-to-earth-filming-locations-for-the-red-planet) by Jenna Scherer, Condé Nast

One of the latest speculative forays to the fourth planet is _The Martian,_Ridley Scott’s Oscar-nominated flick about an astronaut (Matt Damon) who winds up stranded on the planet’s surface and must figure out a way to survive solo. To approximate Mars’s dusty red environs, Scott shot the movie’s exteriors in Wadi Rum in southern Jordan. Also called the Valley of the Moon, the 278-square-mile protected area looks about as Martian as you’re likely to find on Earth.

This isn’t the first time Wadi Rum has played Mars on film. Scenes from two 2000 thrillers, _Red Planet_and _Mission to Mars,_were also shot here, as was 2013’s _The Last Days on Mars._(The valley has also played itself, most notably in David Lean’s 1962 masterpiece _Lawrence of Arabia._)
