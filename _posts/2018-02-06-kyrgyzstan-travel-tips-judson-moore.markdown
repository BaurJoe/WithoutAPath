## Kyrgyzstan Travel Tips, Judson Moore

Judson Moore knew he wanted to make the world better place at an admirably young age. After backpacking around Brazil between high school and college, he finally started to get a sense of how he could contribute. This eventually led him to the Peace Corps and serving in the Central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan. Judson joins Without A Path to share on-the-ground stories, from the horrific experience of watching a goat sacrifice to his own Kyrgyzstan travel tips so you can follow in his footsteps.

<blockquote>"I solo backpacked Brazil. I was visiting friends, people who I had met along the way, and many of their families were also involved in their local Rotary Clubs, and so I participated in a lot of service projects across Brazil through these Rotary Clubs. It was the combination of these two things that instilled in me a very real passion for international travel, international relationships, and a sense of my ability to one day make the world a better place in some small way."</blockquote>
