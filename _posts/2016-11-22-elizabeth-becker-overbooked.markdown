[Elizabeth Becker](http://www.elizabethbecker.com/), author of [_Overbooked: The Exploding Business of Travel and Tourism_](https://www.amazon.com/Overbooked-Exploding-Business-Travel-Tourism/dp/1439161003/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479799895&sr=8-1&keywords=overbooked+the+exploding+business+of+travel+and+tourism), joins Without A Path to talk about the industry's impact around the world, from lessons to follow in Bordeaux, France to overcrowded destinations like Venice that could learn a thing or two from the French. She also discusses environmental concerns that come out of the tourism industry, namely the large carbon footprint left by the cruise industry culprits, such as Royal Caribbean International. Finally, we discuss how the travel writer fits into all of this and what the average traveler can do to ensure they're traveling responsibly.

_Overbooked: The Exploding Business of Travel and Tourism_ is now available in paperback.
